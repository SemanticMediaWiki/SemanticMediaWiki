== Changes in SMW1.0 as compared to SMW0.7 ==

* Simplified semantic annotations: just one kind of annotation ("Property").
* Significant speedup (both server and network load substantially reduced,
  faster RDF export, more efficient query result formatting).
* Prettier and easier to understand interfaces:
  ** New tooltips for warnings and addtional information.
  ** Simplified factbox layout, with all properties in alphabetic order.
  ** Inline warnings to simplify trouble shooting with annotations.
  ** Improved, more helpful and informative warning and error messages.
  ** Highlighting for built-in elements. E.g. built-in types are visually
     distinguished from arbitrary types; useful as visual feedback.
  ** Error/warning reporting for (inline) queries.
* More powerful output formatting for semantic querying:
  ** new {{#ask:...}} parser function syntax for inline queries, fully 
     compatible with MediaWiki templates, template parameters, and parser
     functions of other extension
  ** more readable inline query structure in #ask parser function,
     printouts separated from query
  ** semantic RSS feeds making feeds from query results via "format=rss"
  ** new prinout format "?Category:Name" for #ask
  ** option to hide main column by setting "mainlabel=-", and reinserting
     via print request "?" (only for #ask)
* More expressivity for semantic querying:
  ** support for subproperties,
  ** improved equality resolution (redirects),
  ** support for disjunctions,
  ** inequality check for datavalues ("[[property::!value]]")
  ** optional pattern matching for string values ("[[property::~Semant*]]")
  ** automatic sorting on sort-parameter (no additional condition needed)
* New/improved datatypes:
  ** Type:Page for explicitly specifying properties that are "relations"
  ** better media support in Type:Page: special treatment of Image: and Media:
  ** Type:Number as universal replacement for Type:Integer and Type:Float
  ** Type:URL as universal replacement for old Type:URL and Type:URI
  ** Type:Geographic coordinates completely rewritten. More input formats
     supported, more liberal parsing to accept most inputs
  ** special property "allows value" works for all types
  ** display units are now easier to select via property "display units"
  ** Improved data display: URL-links and tooltips work for queries results
     and on special pages
* Improved special pages:
  ** simpler interface for Special:Ask, hide query when using "further results" link
  ** hints and warning for property usage/declaration in Special:Properties
  ** extra information and warnings for types on Special:Types
  ** Special:SemanticStatistics as faster replacement for earlier "ExtendedStatistics"
* Better internationalisation:
  ** updates in all translation files
  ** new translations to Dutch, Chinese (tw/ch), Korean (beta)
  ** alias strings for all SMW elements; English labels are allowed in all
     languages, names of old SMW elements still work as aliases for their
     replacements.
* New experimental n-ary properties, allowing property values to consist of
  a list of entries.
* Ontology import re-enabled (simple annotation import)
* Maintenance script SMW_refreshData now can rebuild all SMW data structures, fixing
  even exotic database problems on most sites.
* New maintenance script for announcing site to Semantic Web crawlers.
* Support for upcoming MediaWiki 1.12
* Improved APIs and various new hooks to simplify the life of SMW extension developers.
* Many bugfixes.

Other changes for SMW1.0 include:
* Type:Enum became obsolete, since all types now suppport "allows value", but it
  remains an alias for Type:String.
* Some configurtation options for LocalSettings.php have changed. Read INSTALL
  for details on how to upgrade from your old installation.

* Type:Enum became obsolete, since all types now suppport "allows value", but it 
  remains an alias for Type:String.
* Service links are not working in this Release Candidate yet, especially coordinate
  values do not link to maps yet. This will reappear before SMW1.0 final.


== Semantic MediaWiki 0.7 ==

* New browsing interface for semantic data: Special:Browse
* Improved simple searching interfaces, making the old Special:Searchtriple
  obsolete by various new interlinked special pages.
* New formatting options for inline queries:
** Template-based formatting for formats "list" and "template"
** Transclusion of result articles with format "embedded"
** Counting query results with format count.
* New datatype for enumerated string values (Type:Enum).
* Pages of attributes and relations now list all uses of these properties.
* Pages of types now list all attributes using a type.
* New Special:WantedRelations showing relations that are used but have no page.
* Improved support for arbitrary symbols in string values, including wiki links
  and HTML entities (now correct in RDF).
* Improved headers for query tables, with sort icon and link to attribute/relation
  seperated.
* Added maintenance script to rebuild semantic data, thus fixing any inconsistencies 
  in the semantic database that may have occurred earlier or due to text-only imports
  of pages.
* Translations to further languages, including Hebrew (right-to-left).
* New cleaner storage implementation, allowing to run MediaWiki parsertests with the 
  option $smwgDefaultStore = SMW_STORE_TESTING; in LocalSettings.php.
* MediaWiki-1.10-Ready ;-)
* Simplified installation (no more manual patching with MediaWiki 1.10).
* Many bugfixes.

== Semantic MediaWiki 0.6 ==

* New Special:Ask for directly browsing query results and for testing queries.
* New output format "timeline" for inline queries that deal with dates. Available
  parameters are: timelinestart (name of start date attribute), timelineend (name 
  of end date attribute, if any), tiemlinesize (CSS-encoded height), timelinebands
  (comma-seperated list of bands such as DAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR, ...), and
  timelineposition (one of start, end, today, middle).
* Complete RDF export is now possible with a maintenance script, which can e.g. be
  run periodically on a server to create RDF files.
* New "service links" feature: any attribute can provide configurable links to
  online services. As a special case, the map-services of geo-coordinates are now
  fully configurable.
* Inline queries now link to life search for further results if not all results
  were shown inline.
* The formatting code for inline queries was rewritten to become more powerful.
  For instance, multi-property outputs in list format will never produce empty
  parentheses now.
* RDF-export code is cleaner and some further OWL DL incompatibilities are caught.
* RDF-export now can generate browsable RDF (with backlinks) even for Category
  pages.
* Improved headers for sorting tables. Sort icon now visible even if no text is 
  shown in header.
* Many bugfixes.

== Semantic MediaWiki 0.5 ==

* Customised datatypes for unit conversion: it is now possible to create customised
  linear unit conversions by appropriate statements on type articles. This also 
  enables full localisation of all units of measurement.
* Customized display of units: every attribute can now decide which units to display
  in factbox and query results. Internally, values are still normalised, but users
  can adjust the view to the most common description of some attribute.
* Support for importing vocabularies from external ontologies. For instance, elements
  of the wiki can now be mapped to the FOAF ontology during export. The import is
  controlled by whitelist-like message articles.
* New attribute datatypes for URLs and URIs, some of which can be exported in RDF as 
  ObjectProperties. A blacklist is used to prevent technically problematic URIs from 
  being used there (e.g. most don't want to use OWL language elements as data).
* New attribute datatype for temperature, since this cannot be defined by a linear 
  custom unit conversion.
* Improved Special:Relations and Special:Attributes, including a quicklink to searching
  occurrences of some annotation.
* Unit support for inline queries. Desired output unit can be adjusted through query.
* Improved code layout, using object-orientation features of PHP5.
* Many bugfixes.

== Semantic MediaWiki 0.4.3.2 ==

This fixes another small bug that prevented the limit parameter in queries to work
properly.

== Semantic MediaWiki 0.4.3.1 ==

This fixes a small but critical bug that prevented queries for non-numeric attribute
values to work properly.

== Semantic MediaWiki 0.4.3 ==

Semantic MediaWiki 0.4.3 is an intermediate release that greatly improves the
performance and features of inline queries. It also includes some major code
cleanups and various bugfixes.

An updated documentation of the current inline queries is (soon) to be found at
http://wiki.ontoworld.org/index.php/Help:Inline_queries

== Semantic MediaWiki 0.4 ==

Semantic MediaWiki 0.4 includes the following new features:

* Support for inline queries: it is now possible to <ask> queries in
  articles, the answers of which are included into the displayed page.
  Conjunctions and nesting of queries is supported. Datatype queries
  for values above or below some threshold are possible. Outputs can be
  displayed in many different formats, including bulleted and numbered 
  lists, tables with intercative (JScript) sorting (credits go to 
  Stuart Langridge for www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/), and 
  plain text. See http://wiki.ontoworld.org/index.php/Help:Inline_queries 
  for documentation.
* Improved output for Special:Relations and Special:Attributes: usage of
  relations and attributes is now counted
* Improved ontology import feature, allowing to import ontologies and to
  update existing pages with new ontological information
* Experimental suport for date/time datatype
* More datypes with units: mass and time duration
* Support for EXP-notation with numbers, as e.g. 2.345e13. Improved number
  formating in infobox.
* Configurable infobox: infobox can be hidden if empty, or switched off
  completely. This also works around a bug with MediaWiki galeries.
* Prototype version of Special:Types, showing all available datatypes with 
  their names in the current language setting.
* "[[:located in::Paris]]" will now be rendered as "located in [[Paris]]"
* More efficient storage: changed database layout, indexes for fast search
* Code cleaned up, new style guidelines
* Bugfixes, bugfixes, and some more bugfixes

Semantic MediaWiki 0.4 has not been tested on MediaWiki below 1.6.1 and might
fail to operate correctly in this case. Some functions explicitly use code 
that was introduced in 1.6.

== Semantic MediaWiki 0.3 ==

Changes by mak (0.3, 06 Apr 2006):

* Compatibility updates for MediaWiki 1.6

Changes by denny/mak (0.3, 25 Mar 2006):

* Internal: improved management of special properties
* RDF export: OWL conformant export of all available content data, including category information
* RDF export: recursive export, "streaming"
* UI: further internationalization, internationalized float number format (decimal separator)
* UI: new infobox section for recognized special properties
* new Specials to show all relations/attibutes
* new experimental Special to import data from existing OWL/RDF ontologies
* new special property "equivalent URI" that allows to map wiki concepts to URIs in other ontologies

Changes by kai/mak (0.3preview, 15 Mar 2006):

* Internal: new internal storage management; cleaner, more flexible, and more efficient
* Internal: new internal type registration API
* Internal: new internal management for special properties (e.g. 'has type')
* Internationalization: almost complete; namespaces, special properties (e.g. 'has type'), datatype labels
* RDF export: support for multiple mimetypes (rdf+xml and xml); needed for Piggybank
* RDF export: support for bulk export
* RDF export: XSD datatypes and correct instance classification (rdf:type)
* UI: extended Special:SMWAdmin to convert data from old internal datatable to new format
* UI: duplicate attribute values eliminated in infobox
* UI: types can switch off quicksearch links
* UI: more human-oriented error mesages ;-)
* UI: service links for infobox and search
* new datatype for geographic coordinates, accepting many kinds of coordinate inputs, and providing links to standard mapsources
* Simple semantic search supports imprecise search again

Changes by mak (0.2c, 9 Mar 2006):

* added basic language support functionality
* improved installation process (SMW_LocalSettings.php, simpler patching for Setup.php)

Changes by mak (0.2c, 1 Mar 2006):

* RDF Export enabled
* more CSS and an icon to show RDF download link on pages

Changes by kai/mak (0.2c, Feb 2006):

* Added new custom stylesheet and JScript (kai/mak)
* New JScript tooltips (kai)
* New style for infobox search items (mak)

Changes by mak (0.2c, Feb 2006):

* Added new Special:SMWAdmin that allows relatively painless upgrade
  from versions <=0.2 where no namespaces were used.
* Added support for moving pages with its stored triples.
* BUGFIX: triples in articles with SQL-hostile symbols (e.g. ') are
  now working.

== Semantic MediaWiki 0.2b ==

Changes by mak (0.2b, Jan 2006):
* Changed directory structure for more clarity, easier installation
  and upgrade.
* Now using custom namespaces for Relations, Attributes, and Types,
  and their talks.
* Semantic features can be switched on or off for each namespace 
  individually.
* Registered extension for MediaWiki's "Special:Version".
* BUGFIX: Configuration now takes fixed servername to use in storing
  URIs. Before, different access methods (e.g. direct IP vs. servername)
  generated different URIs.
* BUGFIX: Attributes that could not be parsed now do not generate 
  triples with empty object in our database.

Changes by mak (0.2a, 4 Dec 2005):
* Attribute values are now correctly stored and retrieved.
* Special SearchTriple greatly enhanced, such that queries for
  attributes become possible (including unit conversion).
* Links from attributes in infobox to the new search form.
* Major code cleanup: SMW_AttributeStore.php now is called
  SMW_SemanticData.php and managemes all types of semantic
  data, including printout and storage. SMW_Hooks.php was freed
  of all code with similar purpose. Look-up of attribute types
  was moved from SemanticData to Datatype. 

Changes by mak (0.1b, 1 Dec 2005):
* Reworked internal data representation. All information now is
  properly encoded in URIs and decoded for display. This is an
  important prerequisite for storing attributes and auxilliary
  triples, which otherwise could not be distinguished from the
  relational information.
* New Special SearchTriple to replace the current SearchSemantic,
  which is currently only half functional since it believes that
  the database contains only simple names for articles, but not
  full URIs.
* Minor adjustments in handling of namespaces: namespaced aritcles
  now properly work as subjects and are displayed with namespace in
  in the infobox.

Changes by mak (0.1b, 19 Nov 2005):

* New type management; attributes can now be declared by creating 
  relations of type "has type" inside their articles (Attribute:X).
  Possible targets are the builtin types (Type:String, Type:Geographic
  length, etc.).
* New internal method SMWGetTriples for directly retrieving triples 
  from the storage. Accepts subject, predicate, object pairs, where
  any two can be left out.
* Improved layout for infoboxes.

Changes by mak (0.1b, 13 Nov 2005):

* added support for separator "," in data numbers,
* added tooltips for unit conversion.

Changes by mak (0.1b, 17 Oct 2005):

* added attribute support [[attribute name:=value|alternative text]];
  currently, parsing these within the article works, including an 
  info box at the bottom; however, assignment from attributes to 
  datatypes is still hardcoded and attribute-annotations are neither
  stored as triples nor are they supported in search,
* added basic type support for STRING, INTEGER, and FLOAT,
* added framework for unit conversion and first unit support: unit
  conversion is achieved by callback functions, so that adding types
  for new units boils down to writing a single unit conversion function,
* code split into several files for easier colaboration of developers,
* new naming convention "SMW"-prefix for all top level code elements of 
  the extension,
* moved main storage methods to SMW_Storage.php, this should simplify
  the conversion to another storage backend (triplestore),
* moved stripping of semantic relations to SMW_Stripsemantics.php;
  if this feature is desired, this file needs to be updated slightly
  (also to include semantic attributes) and its methods connected to
  their appropriate hooks as done in 0.1

Changes by mak (0.1a, 4 Oct 2005):

* moved parsing process to ParserAfterStrip to support <nowiki>; it 
  has to be done even later to support template inclusion properly,
* changed process of storing/retrieving: no more stripping of semantic
  relations before saving -- the annotations now appear exactly where
  the user has put them, keeping them easier to read and maintain,
* parse only once: saving is based on the relations that were retrieved
  during the earlier call of parse(); for this to work, saving needs to
  be deferred -- it is currently done at ArticleSaveComplete [should
  there be a dedicated hook for deferred saving?],
* enabled removal of semantic links on article deletion,
* changed layout of semantic links factsheet, including some neat grouping 
  feature.

== Semantic MediaWiki 0.1 ==

This is a pre-alpha version of the Semantic MediaWiki extensions. 
It includes:

* support for typed links [[link type::link target|link label]],
* rendering of fact sheet on semantic relations at article bottom,
* Special:SearchSemantic (alpha), featuring autocompletion for 
  link types.
