## I

Integration test (or functional test) normally combines multiple components into a single process and verifies the results in a semi-production like environment (including DB access, sample data etc.).

## J

JSONScript is an abstraction from the PHPUnit layer and a best practice approach in Semantic MediaWiki to write integration tests as pseudo `JSONScript` to allow non-developers to review and understand the setup and requirements of its test scenarios.

## U

Unit test refers to a script that verifies results for a unit, module, or class against an expected outcome in an isolated environment.
