About Semantic MediaWiki
========================

Semantic MediaWiki is a project for extending MediaWiki with "semantic"
functions that enable machine-reading of wiki-content. For details and
further links, see [the SMW wiki](https://semantic-mediawiki.org).

Notes on installing Semantic MediaWiki are found in the [INSTALL file](docs/INSTALL.md).
