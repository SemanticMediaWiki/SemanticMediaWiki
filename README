functions that enable machine-reading of wiki-content. For details and
further links, see http://semantic-mediawiki.org

== Developers ==

Development is coordinated by Markus Krötzsch and Denny Vrandecic.

Semantic MediaWiki development is partially funded by Institut AIFB of the
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany; see http://www.aifb.kit.edu
Specific development tasks have been supported by the European Union under the
projects SEKT, NeOn, and Active. SMW has also been supported in the
Halo project funded by Vulcan Inc., where development is coordinated
by ontoprise GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany.

== Contributors ==

* Heiko Haller and Max Völkel contributed to the initial design and basic
  architectural decisions.

== Translations ==

Translations to various languages are provided and maintained by many people.
In general, main contributors can be found in the message files. Special thanks
are due to Siebrand Mazeland and the translatewiki.net project for the
excellent translation service they provide.

== Credits to other projects ==

* Most icons used by Semantic MediaWiki are derived from the "Crystal Clear"
  icon theme for KDE, which was created by Everaldo (everaldo.com).

* The code contains a minified version of the jQuery JavaScript library
  (http://jquery.com/), developed by John Resig and the jQuery team.

* Many people have contributed to the project by providing helpful comments and
  suggestions. Among them are the members of the Semantic Wiki Interest Group
  (swikig@aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de; see semanticweb.org), the people at the project
  mailing lists, and a number of anonymous reviewers. Thanks a lot!
