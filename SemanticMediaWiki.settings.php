#    CHANGING THE CONFIGURATION FOR SEMANTIC MEDIAWIKI          #
#################################################################

###
# Configure SPARQL database connection for Semantic MediaWiki. This is used
# when SPARQL-based features are enabled, e.g. when using SMWSparqlStore as
# the $smwgDefaultStore.
#
# The default class SMWSparqlDatabase works with many databases that support
# SPARQL and SPARQL Update. Three different endpoints (service URLs) are given
# for query (reading queries like SELECT), update (SPARQL Update queries), and
# data (SPARQL HTTP Protocol for Graph Management). The query endpoint is
# necessary, but the update and data endpoints can be omitted if not supported.
# This will lead to reduced functionality (e.g. the SMWSparqlStore will not
# work if Update is not available). The data endpoint is always optional, but
# in some SPARQL databases this method is more efficient than update.
#
# The default graph is similar to a database name in relational databases. It
# can be set to any URI (e.g. the main page uri of your wiki with
# "#graph" appended). Leaving the default graph URI empty only works if the
# store is configure to use some default default graph or if it generally
# supports this. Different wikis should normally use different default graphs
# unless there is a good reason to share one graph.

# In case of 'smwgDeleteSubjectWithAssociatesRefresh' => TRUE the deletion
# process will initiate a refresh/update process of associative entities.
#
# It is suggested that the dispatch process of those entities are being carried
# out as deferred job 'smwgDeleteSubjectAsDeferredJob' => TRUE and the to minimize
# any performance degradation that can occur when a large pool of associates is
# assigned to the deleted subject.
#
# When 'smwgDeleteSubjectAsDeferredJob' => TRUE, MW 1.19/1.20 will return a
# 'Array to string conversion in JobQueue' because of an outdated JobQueue class
# it is therefore advised to update to a newer MW version or not to use this
# feature.
#
# The subject is always removed directly (without delay) and if selected the update
# of associative entities will always be carried out through a background job (as long as
# smwgEnableUpdateJobs is set true).
