== Disclaimer ==

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

In general, the extension can be installed into a working wiki without making
any irreversible changes to the source code or database, so you can try out
the software without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall mechanism is
provided). Every serious wiki should be subject to regular database backups!
If you have any specific questions, please contact the authors.


== Requirements ==

* MediaWiki 1.11.* or greater (tested from 1.11.0 to 1.14alpha (r40427)).
* PHP 5.x or greater installed and working
* MySQL >= 4.0.14 (version required by MediaWiki)

Notes:
* SMW 1.2 currently has no Postgres support. It could be done if someone cares
  to support this action.
* SMW uses the PHP mb_*() multibyte functions such as mb_strpos in the 
  php_mbstring.dll extension. This is standard but not enabled by default on 
  some distributions of PHP.
  See http://php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php#mbstring.installation
* For installation and upgrade, SMW needs the rights to create new tables
  (CREATE) and to alter tables (ALTER TABLE). Both can be removed again after
  SMW was set up. The script SMW_setup.php can use the DB credentials from
  AdminSettings.php for this purpose, avoiding the need of extra rights for
  the wiki DB user.
* SMW creates and alters temporary tables for certain semantic queries. To do
  this, your wikidb user must have privileges for CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES. The
  according features can be disabled by adding the following to
  Localsettings.php:

  $smwgQSubcategoryDepth=0;
  $smwgQPropertyDepth=0;
  $smwgQFeatures        = SMW_ANY_QUERY & ~SMW_DISJUNCTION_QUERY;
  $smwgQConceptFeatures = SMW_ANY_QUERY & ~SMW_DISJUNCTION_QUERY &
                          ~SMW_CONCEPT_QUERY;


== Installation ==

If you upgrade an existing installation of Semantic MediaWiki, also read the
remarks in the section "Notes on Upgrading" below!

(1) Extract the archive or check out the current files from SVN to obtain the
    directory "SemanticMediaWiki" that contains all relevant files. Copy this
    directory to "[wikipath]/extensions/" (or extract/download it there).
    We abbreviate "[wikipath]/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki" as "[SMW_path]".
(2) Insert the following two lines into "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":

       include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');
       enableSemantics('example.org');

    where example.org should be replaced by your server's name (or IP address).
    The latter is needed only once, using the "preferred" name of your server.
    It is no problem to access a site by more than one servername in any case.
    If you have custom namespaces (such as "Portal"), read the note below.
(3) In your wiki, log in as a user with admin status and go to the page
    "Special:SMWAdmin" to do the final setup steps. This can also be done with
    a command-line php script. See [SMW_path]/maintenance/README for details.
    Please consider announcing your new site to the SMW semantic wiki list by
    using the according button on "Special:SMWAdmin".

    Note that this requires persmissions to alter/create database tables, as
    explained in the above note.

(4) If you already have categories in your wiki, they will not immediately be
    available for SMW queries. Category information becomes available if a
    page in a category is edited next time. To make all information available
    immediately, run the script [SMW_path]/maintenance/SMW_refreshData.php
    as described in [SMW_path]/maintenance/README.

'''Remark:'''  Semantic MediaWiki uses ten additional namespace indexes (see
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Custom_namespaces), in the range from
100 to 109. 100 and 101 are only needed if $smwgSMWBetaCompatible is set.
106 and 107 are reserved for the SemanticForms extension and not used by SMW.
If you have your own custom namespaces, you have to set the parameter
$smwgNamespaceIndex before including SMW_Settings.php. See the documentation
$within SMW_Settings.php for details. If you add more namespaces later on,
then you have to assign them to higher numbers than those used by Semantic
MediaWiki.

There is currently no working Postgres support. If you need that, please
contact the developers and support them in adjusting SMW appropriately.

=== Testing your Installation ===

If you are uncertain that everything went well, you can do some testing steps
to check if SMW is set up properly.

Go to the Special:Version page and you should see Semantic MediaWiki (version
nn) listed as a Parser Hook and several wfSMWXxxx functions listed as
Extension Functions.

Create a regular wiki page named "TestSMW", and in it enter the wiki text
  Property test:  [[testproperty::Dummypage]]

When previewing the page before saving, you should see a Factbox at the bottom
of the article that shows your input. After saving the page, click on the link
"Browse properties" in the page's toolbox. This view should show Testproperty
with value Dummypage.

If you don't get these results, check the steps in the Installation section,
consult the FAQ section, then contact the user support list (see the Contact
section).

=== Customising Semantic MediaWiki ===

Semantic MediaWiki can be customised by a number of settings. To do so, you
can set respective parameters somewhere below the line
"include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');"
in your LocalSetting.php. For example, one can write

 include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');
 $smwgQDefaultLimit = 20;
 enableSemantics('example.org');

to have only 20 results of inline queries being shown by default. The
parameters that are available are documented in the file SMW_Settings.php. Do
not change this file directly, but put adoptions into your LocalSettings.php.

Further options are explained at
http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Configuration

=== Running SMW on older versions of MediaWiki ===

If your site is still running on PHP4, SMW is not supported. It would hardly
be possible to backport the code to the old PHP version. If you have PHP5 but
an older MediaWiki version, additional patches/modifications might be needed.
Download an older release of SMW and have a look at the included INSTALL
instructions to find out whether other changes are recommended therein.


== Upgrading existing installations ==

SMW 1.3 does not require major steps for upgrading from SMW 1.2. You can follow
the same steps as for new installations above (you just do not need to edit
LocalSettings.php). Especially, you must trigger the SMW database setup via
Special:SMWAdmin or using the script SMW_setup.php. Further actions may be
required only if one of the following applies to you.

If you still use a version before SMW 1.2, follow the upgrading instructions
given at 
http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Installation_1.2#Notes_on_Upgrading,
or SMW will not be working any more. If you have a version that is even older 
than SMW 1.0, then read the installation steps given for your version in the
installation instructions for SMW 1.1:
http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Installation_1.1#Notes_on_Upgrading

If you use imported vocabulary, you will have to re-store the data for all
pages that use the property imported from. This can often be done manually by
just editing those (typically few) pages. If there are many affected pages, use
the script to repair all data at once.

If you use concepts, then it might be useful to re-store the data for the
concept pages, but only if you are interested in using the new concept caching
features of SMW. Otherwise concepts will also continue to work normally without
taking any actions.

=== Changed configuration options ===

Some configuration options (used in LocalSettings.php) have changed since SMW
1.0. All settings are documented in detail in the file SMW_Settings.php. The
following list gives the version in which a setting was first introduced, so it
can be ignored if you already run this version or a more recent one.

* [1.3] Since SMW 1.3, the Factbox is hidden by default and will only appear.
As a compensation, the toolbox (usually on the left below the search field)
shows a link to Special:Browse. To use the display behaviour of the Factbox as
it was before SMW 1.3, set $smwgShowFactbox = SMW_FACTBOX_NONEMPTY; The new
link and the Factbox during editing can also be configured; see
SMW_Settings.php for details.

* [1.2.1] SMW will no longer support nested link syntax in property values by
default, since this was known to cause problems. To re-enable this, set
$smwgLinksInValues = true;

* [1.2] If your wiki uses <ask> syntax or the Relation: namespace, you may want
to set $smwgSMWBetaCompatible = true; before the line including
SMW_Settings.php in LocalSettings.php. Consider changing <ask> to #ask to be
able to drop SMW beta compatibility.

* [1.2] If you had a setting $smwgQDisjunctionSupport = false, then you now
need the following settings:

 $smwgQFeatures        = SMW_ANY_QUERY & ~SMW_DISJUNCTION_QUERY;
 $smwgQConceptFeatures = SMW_ANY_QUERY & ~SMW_DISJUNCTION_QUERY & ~SMW_CONCEPT_QUERY;

Older configuration changes are found online, see
http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Installation_1.3


== Troubleshooting ==

Some technical problems are well known and have easy fixes. Please view the 
online manual: http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Troubleshooting

== SMW is installed. What should I do now? ==

Semantic MediaWiki is there to help you to structure your data, so that you
can browse and search it easier. Typically, you should first add semantic 
markup to articles that cover a topic that is typical for your wiki. A single
article, semantic or not, will not improve your search capabilities.

Start with a kind of article that occurs often in your wiki, possibly with
some type of articles that is already collected in some category, such as
cities, persons, or software projects. For these articles, introduce a few
properties, and annotate many of the articles with the property. As with 
categories, less is often more in semantic annotation: do not use overly 
specific properties. A property that is not applicable to at least ten
articles is hardly useful.

Templates can greatly simplify initial annotation. Create a flashy template
for your users to play with, and hide the semantic annotations in the code
of the template. Use the ParserFunctions extension to implement optional
parameters, so that your users can leave fields in the template unspecified
without creating faulty annotations.

Develop suitable inline queries ({{#ask: ... }}) along with any new
annotation. If you don't know how to use some annotation for searching, or
if you are not interested in searching for the annotated information anyway,
then you should probably not take the effort in the first place. Annotate
in a goal-directed way! Not all information can be extracted from the
annotations in your wiki. E.g. one can currently not search for articles that
are *not* in a given category. Think about what you want to ask for before
editing half of your wiki with new semantics ...

If in doubt, choose simple annotations and learn to combine them into more
complex information. For example, you do not need to have a category for
"European cities" -- just combine "located in::Europe" and "Category:City."
If European cities are important for your wiki, you can create a Concept
page for storing that particular query. In any case, if some annotation is
not sufficient, you can still add more information. Cleaning too specific
and possibly contradictory annotations can be more problematic.

Regularly review users' use of categories, properties, and types using
the Special pages for each.
