== Disclaimer ==

Semantic MediaWiki can be used for production wikis, but please note
that the software is still under development. In general, the extension
can be installed into a working wiki without making any irreversible
changes to the source code or database, so you can try out the software
without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall mechanism is provided).
Every serious wiki should be subject to regular database backups. If you
have any specific questions, please contact the authors.

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

== Requirements ==

- MediaWiki 1.9.* or 1.10 (versions >=1.7 might still work)
- PHP 5.x or greater installed and working
- MySQL >= 4.0.14 (version required by MediaWiki)

=== Requirements notes ===

* SMW is (currently) incompatible with PostgreSQL 

* SMW uses the PHP mb_*() multibyte functions such as mb_strpos in the
php_mbstring.dll extension. This is standard but not enabled by default
on some distributions of PHP.
See http://php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php#mbstring.installation

== Installation ==

If you upgrade an existing installation of Semantic MediaWiki, also read the
remarks in the section "Notes on Upgrading" below!

(1) Extract the archive or check out the current files from SVN to obtain the
    directory "SemanticMediaWiki" that contains all relevant files. Copy this
    directory to "[wikipath]/extensions/" (or extract/download it to this place).
    We abbreviate "[wikipath]/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki" as "[SMW_path]" below.
(2) If you use MediaWiki 1.9 or lower, you *must* manually change the file
    "[wikipath]/includes/Parser.php". Open the file in some text editor and find
    the first line "$text = $this->replaceVariables( $text, $args );" located
    around line 1000 in the function "internalParse". Right after this line, insert 
    the new line:

      wfRunHooks( 'InternalParseBeforeLinks', array( &$this, &$text ) );

    Users of MediaWiki 1.10 or greater do not have to do this.
(3) Insert the following lines into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
     include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');
     enableSemantics('example.org');
    where example.org should be replaced by your server's name (or IP address).
    If you have custom namespaces (e.g. "Portal"), read the note below.
(4) In your wiki, log in as a user with admin status and go to the page
    "Special:SMWAdmin" to do the final setup steps.

'''Remark:'''  Semantic MediaWiki uses six additional custom namespaces (see
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Custom_namespaces). If you have your own
custom namespaces, you have to set the parameter $smwgNamespaceIndex  before
including SMW_Settings.php. See the documentation within SMW_Settings.php for
details. If you add more namespaces later on, then you have to assign them to
higher numbers than those used by Semantic MediaWiki.

=== Customising Semantic MediaWiki ===

Semantic MediaWiki can be customised by a number of settings. To do so, you
can set respective parameters somewhere below the line
"include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');"
in your LocalSetting.php. For example, one can write

 include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');
 $smwgIQDefaultLinking = 'all';
 enableSemantics('example.org');

to enable links on all results returned by inline queries. The parameters that
are available are documented in the file SMW_Settings.php.

=== Running SMW on older versions of MediaWiki ===

If your site is still running on PHP4, SMW is not supported. It would hardly be 
possible to backport the code to the old PHP version. If you have PHP5 but an 
older MediaWiki version, additional patches/modifications might be needed.
Download an older release of SMW and have a look at the included INSTALL
instructions to find out whether other changes are recommended therein.

== Notes on Upgrading ==

* This SVN Version des not provide a simple upgrade mechanism for existing wikis yet. *
* If you upgrade, trigger Special:SMWAdmin again and run the maintenance script       *
* "SMW_refreshData.php" twice (the first run can be restricted to properties using    *
* the parameter -p.                                                                   *

The below instructions describe how to upgrade from one minor version to the next, e.g.
from 0.2 (or 0.2b) to 0.3. If you missed one of the updates (e.g. if you want to jump
from 0.1 to 0.3) then it is wise to proceed stepwise: install all intermediate versions
subsequently and follow the given update instructions. For example, first upgrade from 0.1
to 0.2 before upgrading further from 0.2 to 0.3. Also, do not forget to backup your
database before any upgrade.

'''Upgrading from version 0.6 or 0.5'''

Go to Special:SMWAdmin and press the setup button there. From  any patch in MediaWiki is
now obsolete (but your changes should have vanished when MediaWiki 1.10 anyway).

The file SMW_LocalSettings.php is now obsolete. Modify your LocalSettings.php as described
above, and import your changes in SMW_LocalSettings.php, if any, into LocalSettings.php as
well.

'''Upgrading from 0.4.x:'''

Upgrading does not require any special changes. However, you have to upgrade MediaWiki
and SMW. This should not be a problem, and in fact you need one patch less.

The type "Geographic area" and "Geographic length" are no longer built in. But you can
easily create them by yourself with the new type customisation features. See the docu at
ontoworld.org for details.


== Testing your Installation ==

If you are uncertain that everything went well, you can do some testing steps to
check if SMW is set up properly.

Go to the Special:Version page and you should see Semantic MediaWiki (version nn)
listed as a Parser Hook and several wfSMWXxxx functions listed as Extension 
Functions.

Create a regular wiki page named "TestSMW", and in it enter the wiki text
  Relation test:  [[testrelation::Dummypage]]
  Attribute test: [[testattribute:=dummyvalue]]

when you preview and save the page, the SMW "Factbox" should appear showing the
relation Testrelation to Dummypage and the attribute Testattribute with a warning
(since you haven't given it a type).

If you don't get these results, check the steps in the Installation section, consult
the FAQ section, then contact the user support list (see the Contact section).

== FAQ ==

- Problem: I installed Semantic MediaWiki and all went fine. What should I do
  with it now?

  Semantic MediaWiki is there to help you to structure your data, so that you
  can browse and search it easier. Typically, you should first add semantic 
  markup to articles that cover a topic that is typical for your wiki. A single
  article, semantic or not, will not improve your search capabilities.

  Start with a kind of article that occurs often in your wiki, possibly with
  some type of articles that is already collected in some category, such as
  cities, persons, or software projects. For these articles, introduce a small
  amount of relations and attributes, and annotate many of the articles in
  this way. As with categories, less is often more in semantic annotation: do
  not use overly specific relations or attributes. A relation that is not
  applicable in at least ten or twenty articles is hardly useful.

  Templates can greatly simplify initial annotation. Create a flashy template
  for your users to play with, and hide the semantic annotations in the code
  of the template. Use the ParserFunctions extension to implement optional
  parameters, so that your users can leave fields in the template unspecified
  without creating faulty annotations.

  Develop suitable inline queries (<ask> ... </ask>) along with any new
  annotation. If you don't know how to use some annotation for searching, or
  if you are not interested in searching for the annotated information anyway,
  then you should probably not take the effort in the first place. Annotate
  in a goal-directed way! Not all information can be extracted from the
  annotations in your wiki. E.g. one can currently not search for articles that
  are *not* in a given category. Think about what you want to ask for before
  editing half of your wiki with new semantics ...

  If in doubt, choose simple annotations and learn to combine them into more
  complex information. For example, you do not need to have a category for
  "European cities" -- just combine "located in::Europe" and "Category:City."
  In any case, if some annotation is not sufficient, you can still add more
  information. Cleaning too specific and possibly contradictory annotations
  can be more problematic.

  Regularly review users' use of categories, relations, attributes, and types
  using the Special pages for each.

- Problem: Previewing or storing articles with semantic relations causes
  database errors.

  Your database was not initialized properly. Go to Special:SMWAdmin for
  instructions.

- Problem: When using annotations like [[located in::Europe]], the semantic
  data is not extracted, and a link to an article called "located in::Europe"
  appears.

  You probably use a version of MediaWiki that is smaller or equal to 1.9.*
  and you did not make the required changes in Parser.php as described above.

- Problem: In my non-English installation, attributes and relations don't
  work even when I follow the examples.

  You must use the localized names for special properties and namespaces.
  Although MediaWiki has some support for canonical (English) names such as
  Category and Special:Allpages, the SMW extension requires localized names.
  Thus in a German wiki, instead of creating a page Attribute:abc with
  [[Has type::Type:String]], you must create page Attribut:abc with
  [[Hat Datentyp::Datentyp:Zeichenkette]]
  The translated strings for each language are in the languages subdirectory.

- Problem: After installing SMW, some or all pages are not displayed at all.
- Problem: In some cases, pages are displayed incompletely, with some parts
  vanishing.

  This is due to the restrictive memory default settings on some sites, and
  is not directly caused by SMW (any additional extension code might cause this).
  Uncomment the line "ini_set( 'memory_limit', '20M' );" in LocalSettings.php
  and possibly adjust the value to your needs.

- Problem: I have a problem that is not in this list.

  Turn on debugging in MediaWiki (try 
  http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/How_to_debug_MediaWiki ) and you should see
  something in the log file.

  Report general bugs at http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/
  where you can also find out whether your problem is known.
  You can also send an email to semediawiki-user@lists.sourceforge.net.
  Provide the versions of PHP and MediaWiki and SMW that you are using, and
  any other extensions (all this information is on the MediaWiki
  Special:Version page).
