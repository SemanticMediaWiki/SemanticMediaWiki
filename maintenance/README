== Semantic MediaWiki maintenance scripts ==

Scripts can be run with a command line PHP call if your MediaWiki is
properly configured to run maintenance scripts.

If you keep SMW in the standard directory ./extensions/SemanticMediaWiki
below your MediaWiki installation, then you can run these scripts from
almost anywhere.

Otherwise, it is required to set the environment variable MW_INSTALL_PATH
to the root of your MediaWiki installation first. This is also required if
you use a symbolic link from ./extensions/SemanticMediaWiki to the actual
installation directory of SMW. Setting environment variables is different
for different operating systems and shells, but can normally be done from
the command line right before the php call. On Bash(Linux), e.g., one can
use the following call to execute SMW_setup.php with different MW location.

  export MW_INSTALL_PATH="/path/to/mediawiki" &&  php SMW_setup.php

In some setups that use a lot of shared code for many wikis, it might be
required to specify the location of LocalSettings.php and AdminSettings.php
explicitly, too:

  export MW_INSTALL_PATH="/path/to/mediawiki" &&
  php SMW_setup.php --conf /path/to/mediawiki/LocalSettings.php --aconf /path/to/mediawiki/AdminSettings.php

(do not give the linebreak in the above command)
